Patient Mr Doe, 38 years. I'm noticing distinct erythema along the medial aspect of the left lower extremity, suggestive of cellulitis. Palpation revealed a palpable cord, indicative of thrombophlebitis, extending proximally from the medial malleolus. Auscultation of the chest disclosed bilateral basal crackles, potentially signifying early pulmonary edema. The patient's history of noncompliance with antihypertensive therapy, coupled with anamnesis of intermittent claudication, raises concerns for underlying peripheral arterial disease.
