Patient Mr. Doe, 38 years I'm noticing distant erythema along the medical aspect of the left lower extremity, suggestive of cellulitis. Palpation revealed a palpable cord indicative of thrombophlebitis, extending proximately from the medial malleolus. Oscillation of the chest disclosed bilateral basal crackles, potentially signifying early pulmonary edema. The patient's history of noncompliance with antihypertensive therapy, coupled with anamnesis of intermittent claudiacation, raises concerns for underlying peripheral arterial disease.
